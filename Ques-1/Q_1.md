## Question-1 (Invert Binary Tree)

- **Submission Link:** [LeetCode Submission](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/submissions/982845364/)
- **Status:** Passed all test cases
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) (where n is number of nodes in tree)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (for function call stack space)
- **Explanation:** This code defines a function called `invertTree` that takes a TreeNode pointer `root` as input and returns another TreeNode pointer. It recursively traverses the binary tree starting from the root node. At each node, it creates a new node called `copy` with the same value as the current node. Then, it recursively calls `invertTree` on the right and left children of the current node, assigning the inverted left child to the `copy`'s right pointer and the inverted right child to the `copy`'s left pointer. Finally, it returns the `copy` node, effectively returning a new binary tree with all its nodes inverted.

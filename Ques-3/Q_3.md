## Question-3 (Validate Binary Search Tree)

- **Submission Link:** [LeetCode Submission](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/submissions/1003797100/)
- **Status:** Passed all test cases
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) (where n is number of nodes in tree)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Explanation:** It verifies if the given tree is binary tree is BST by recursively traversing the tree in an in-order manner, keeping track of the values encountered in a vector. At each node, it verifies if the current value is greater than the last value encountered, ensuring the BST property.

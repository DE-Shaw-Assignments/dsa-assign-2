## Question-5 (Find index of first occurence of string in a string)

### using Hashing: Rabin-Karp

- **Submission Link:** [LeetCode Submission](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/submissions/1156634026)
- **Status:** Passed all test cases
- **Time Complexity:** O(m+n) (in average and best case time-complexity) and O(mn) (in worst case time-complexity)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
- **Explanation:** The submitted code works by calculating hash values for both the needle and successive windows of the haystack. These hash values are compared, and if they match, further verification is done by comparing the actual characters. This approach allows for faster identification of potential matches. As the algorithm progresses through the haystack, it updates the hash values using a rolling hash technique, which involves subtracting the contribution of the first character in the previous window and adding the contribution of the next character in the current window. By leveraging hashing and rolling hash calculations, the Rabin-Karp algorithm offers an efficient solution for substring search tasks.
